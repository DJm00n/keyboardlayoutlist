# Keyboard Layout List

This tool is intended to generate these tables on current running Windows system:
[Keyboard identifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-language-pack-default-values#keyboard-identifiers)
[Input method editors](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-language-pack-default-values#input-method-editors)
[Input locales](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/default-input-locales-for-windows-language-packs#input-locales)

Was written just for fun and to improve Windows docs which had outdated information.
